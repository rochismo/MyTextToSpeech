Release Notes CepstralJavaWrapper v2.
==============
1. System Requirements
2. Feature Support
3. Known issues

1. System Requirements
======================
	1. Operating System.
	2. Software bundles.

1.1 Operating System
	---------------------
The operating systems supported are Windows Vista, Windows XP and Linux.
The wrappers were tested on Windows vista and XP platforms. 
We tested the wrapper on Ubuntu and Fedora Core 9

1.2. Software Bundle
---------------------
The following softwares should be preinstalled for the demos to work
1. Cepstral Voices 5.1
2. Microsoft SAPI 5.1 or higher (for Windows)
3. Visual Studio 2005 or higher for windows platform if you want to compile JNI.
4. GNU Compiler for C++ code (gcc).
5. GNU make utility (if you intend to use the Makefile for compilation).

NOTE:
-----
2. GNU gcc compiler was used for linux. This is not a requirement but other compilers weren't tested
on. Visual studio 2005 with SAPI 5.1 was used for testing the SAPI interface on windows XP. On windows vista
Visual Studio 2008 with SAPI 5.3 was used.
3. SAPI interfaces are packaged in Windows SDK installer.

2. Feature Support
==================
1. The JNI interface loads libraries generically in a platform independent way. This however needs 
the environment variables setup appropriately (see documentation).
2. Added new method to block for speech engine to finish all queued/currently running jobs.
3. Placed a cap on pitch values and speak rates since higher rates seem to crash the engine.
4. JSAPI compliant wrapper has been removed until the wrapper is properly implemented

3. Known Issues
===============
1. On linux, cepstral engine grabs an exclusive lock on audio device. This could be a problem if 
some other audio is playing (for example multimedia content from firefox). An workaround is to 
turn off all the audio playing before generating speech.
2. The cepstral wrapper crash when pitch values and speak rates are changed in quick succession. A work 
around this problem would be to shutdown the engine and restart it after every speech synthesis.
